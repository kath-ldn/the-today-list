v2.0 - Firebase Integration
In this version:
- Integrated Firebase


For next versions:
- Most importantly - refactor code. It is still verbose and repetitive (esp. Firebase).
- Continue to refine UI/UX
- Add useful info to projects when closed - how many tasks, how many high priority tasks.
- Add button to collapse/ shrink the header/sidebar (narrow it to the side - add keyframes). Text and Div size using classnames - everything else should be responsive enough.
- Add ability to change category.
- Add some variation in colors (project boxes?).
- Make responsive for different screen sizes - including min and max widths.
- Colour coordinate to distinguish between projects/tasks
    - E.g. 'new project' lighter and matching project background color.
- Intro bubbles to show how to use.
- 'Are you sure' pop-ups for deleting things.
- Use icons instead of edit and delete task.
- Delete-all button.
- Align PP with modal styles.
- New Date for sample task - make it in future (or else reads 'Due: 0 seconds ago' and is a bit alarming.)
- data not passed in best way - to revisit
-revisit all code [add as known issue] - newish to firebase
-edit project submit glitch - not center
-grid issue - i guess only with empty projects tho
---could hav max items and set span manually
-remove yellow color
