*** TODAYLIST README ***
v1.5
- Refined UI/UX
    - Added sidebar
    - Chnged project name
    - Changed fonts/colors/buttons
- Fixed some glitches
    - edit modal not pre-populating date/priority.
    - Issue with editing the date - changed format
    - Rationalised terminology - categories are now projects, and projects are now tasks. This is to focus on 'today's' tasks rather than long term programmes.
    - Changed projects from my projects to a Sample.
- Refactored code - shortened, removed un-used classes, separated into more modules.

For next version
- Continue to refine UI/UX.
- Add useful info to projects when closed - how many tasks, how many high priority tasks.
- Add button to collapse/ shrink the header/sidebar (narrow it to the side - add keyframes). Text and Div size using classnames - everything else should be responsive enough.
- Continue to rationalise and refine code - still verbose.
- Add ability to change category.
- Add some variation in colors (project boxes?).
- Make responsive for different screen sizes - including min and max widths.
- Colour coordinate to distinguish between projects/tasks
    - E.g. 'new project' lighter and matching project background color.
- Intro bubbles to show how to use.
- 'Are you sure' pop-ups for deleting things.
- Integrate with Firebase!!
